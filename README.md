# FastAPI Template Repository

This repository provides a fast and easy starting point for building RESTful APIs with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). It includes a minimal, yet comprehensive setup to get you up and running quickly, with sensible defaults for projects of any size.

## Features

- **FastAPI**: Fast and modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for interacting with databases.
- **Alembic**: For database migrations.
- **Pydantic**: For data validation and serialization.
- **Docker**: Containerization setup for easy deployment.
- **Testing**: Setup for unit tests and integration tests.
- **Pre-configured CORS**: Easily configurable for cross-origin requests.
- **Environment configuration**: Manage environment variables with `.env` files.
- **Swagger UI**: Automatic generation of API documentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

- Python 3.8 (preferably 3.9 or higher)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (optional, for dependency management)

### Clone the Repository

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sid-146/fastapi-template.git
cd fastapi-template
```

### Create Virtual Env

Using python `venv` module create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

or

```bash
py -m venv venv
```

### Activate Virtual Env

Navigate to Scripts in virtual envrionment.

```bash
cd venv/Scripts
```

run `activate` script. After this your environment will be activated.

### Install Dependencies

Using `pip` (for standard Python environments):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or using `Poetry`:

```bash
poetry install
```

### Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and edit the values as necessary:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Make sure to update your `.env` file with the appropriate settings for your local environment (e.g., database URL, secret keys).

### Run the Application

To run the application, you can use the following command:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

This will start the FastAPI server at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Docker Setup (Optional)

If you prefer using Docker to run the application, you can build and start a container using:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Once the container is up, the app will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Testing

To run tests, use the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

Make sure that your test cases are properly configured in the `tests/` folder.

## Deployment

This template is ready for deployment with Docker and can be deployed on any platform that supports Docker (e.g., AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean).

You can also deploy directly to a cloud service like [Uvicorn with Gunicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) for better production performance.
